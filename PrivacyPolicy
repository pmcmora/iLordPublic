	•	For more information on how AdMob collects and uses data, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy.

ChatGPT API (OpenAI)

	•	The app communicates with OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input.
	•	User inputs (text) are sent to OpenAI servers for processing and response generation.
